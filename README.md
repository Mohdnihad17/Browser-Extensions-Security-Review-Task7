# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective

To identify, analyze, and remove potentially harmful browser extensions and become more aware of browser security practices.

---

## what I done

### 1. Opened Chrome Extensions Manager


### 2. Reviewed Installed Extensions

| Extension Name      | Description                                    | Status     ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- 
 Google Docs Offline | Edit and view Google Docs without internet     | Safe       |
 Pie Adblock         | Blocks ads on YouTube & Twitch, offers rewards | Suspicious 

---

### 3. Analysis & Reasoning

#### Google Docs Offline

* Official extension from Google.
* Limited permissions.
* Frequently used and verified.
* Kept.

#### Pie Adblock

* Not a well-known adblocker (e.g., not uBlock Origin or Adblock Plus).
* Mentions earning rewards, which is a potential red flag.
* Further research showed unclear developer credibility.
* **I chose to keep it for now for personal use, but aware of the risk and will monitor carefully.**

### Actions Taken

* **Kept:** Google Docs Offline
* **Kept:** Pie Adblock (for personal use, after review)

---

### What I Learned

* Some browser extensions can appear helpful but contain hidden threats.
* Always check the publisher, reviews, and permissions.
* Avoid extensions that ask for unnecessary access or offer "rewards."
* Stick to open-source, well-reviewed, or officially published tools.
* Understand trade-offs when deciding whether to remove or retain certain extensions.
